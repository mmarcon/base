#BASE

Base is a very simple HTML5 *boilerplate* with everything that is needed to get started with a web project:

 * skeleton of an HTML5 document -` index.html`;
 * `reset.css`;
 * empty `style.css`;
 * empty `main.js`;

No libraries (e.g. jQuery) or plugins are included. If you need a library or a plugin in your project I would suggest to give [bower](http://bower.io/) a try.
